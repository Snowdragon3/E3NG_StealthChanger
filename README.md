# E3NG StealthChanger

This is a modification for the E3NG by RH3D to convert it into a StealthChanger.

-------THIS IS IN BETA-------- Configs are subject to change but the hardware shouldn't change too much as it is proven to be functional on other printers.

This upgrade requires some parts from the StealthChanger projects. As of June 3rd 2025 some parts are a work in progress.

Any toolhead that is supported by StealthChanger along with any configuration of the E3NG toolhead can be used (note that the E3NG toolhead has yet to be tested with StealthChamger)

Currently the dock is fixed to the bed causing a ~50mm loss in the Y axis but there are plans for another liftbar that will return that space.
